                    Looking for a place to relax, unwind, laugh and connect with other ladies? Our Ladies Ministry strives to provide opportunities that enable ladies not only to find the fellowship they need, but also to enjoy a haven from hectic schedules and to draw closer to God and sisters in Christ.

                    Along with our monthly meetings we also provide various opportunities to reach out to those in our church and community throughout the year. We have special events for ladies to come together to be refreshed and renewed with sisters in Christ.

                    In our Ladies Ministry you will find a place you belong, to be encouraged and strengthened, and to be cared for among a warm and friendly group of Ladies who love the Lord and have a desire to serve Him and others.

                <p>
                    Our prayer is that God will be glorified through this ministry and that it will be of service and value to you in your Christian walk.
