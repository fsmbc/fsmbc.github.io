        <p>
          Step through the mist into Rainforest Falls, overflowing with wild waterfalls, towering trees, and colorful creatures. Beneath a canopy of chattering birds and howling monkeys, kids plunge into a lifelong adventure of discovering the nature of God. They'll explore what it means to be rooted in relationship with God, their creator, a safe place in life's storms.

          <span class="fw-bold text-primary">What do kids do at VBS?</span>
          Kids receive a small meal, participate in memorable Bible-learning activities like Sticky Scripture, sing fun songs, play teamwork-building games during Wild Games, experience one-of-a-kind Rooted Bible Adventures, meet Bible Memory Buddies to remind them of God's love, and test out sciency-fun experiments that get imagination bubbling at Imagination Station. Plus, kids will learn to look for evidence of God all around them through something called God Sightings. Each day concludes with a Canopy Closing that gets everyone (including family and friends!) involved in living what they've learned.

          <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Who can come to VBS?</span>
          VBS is for kids up to and including those entering the 12th grade. We will not have a nursery, so kids under 4 years of age must be accompanied by an adult.
