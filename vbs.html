          July, dates TBD, 5:30pm - 8:45pm

        <p>
          We'll guide kids on the ultimate Alaskan adventure where northern lights glow over majestic mountains, racing rivers, and glistening glaciers. As kids trek the tundra, they'll explore how easy it is to lose sight of what's true in our wild world today. Pointing them toward Jesus, True North VBS shows them that he is a faithful friend we can always trust. He's our True North!

          <span class="fw-bold text-primary">What do kids do at VBS?</span>
          Kids receive a small meal, participate in memorable Bible-learning activities like Sticky Scripture, sing fun songs, play teamwork-building games during Glacier Games, experience one-of-a-kind Wild Bible Adventures, collect Bible Memory Buddies to remind them of God's love, and test out sciency-fun experiments that get imagination bubbling at Imagination Station. Plus, kids will learn to look for evidence of God all around them through something called God Sightings. Each day concludes with a Compass Closing that gets everyone (including family and friends!) involved in living what they've learned.

          VBS is for kids up to and including those entering the 12th grade. We will not have a nursery, so kids under 4 years of age must be accompanied by an adult.
