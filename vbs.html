          We'll take kids deep into an amazing undersea adventure where they’ll experience the ever-flowing, never-ending love of God. During Scuba VBS at Fort Spring Missionary Baptist Church, kids will be immersed in the Word and discover what living water is really all about!

          <span class="fw-bold text-primary">What do kids do at VBS?</span>
          Kids receive a small meal, participate in memorable Bible-learning activities, sing fun songs, play teamwork-building games, experience one-of-a-kind Bible adventures, collect Bible Memory Buddies to remind them of God’s love, and test out sciency-fun experiments that get imagination bubbling. Plus, kids will learn to look for evidence of God all around them through something called God Sightings. Each day concludes with a Fin-tastic Finale that gets everyone (including family and friends!) involved in living what they’ve learned.
        </p>

          <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Who can come to VBS?</span>
          VBS is for kids up to and including those entering the 12th grade. We will not have a nursery, so kids under 4 years of age must be accompanied by an adult.
