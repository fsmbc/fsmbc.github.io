          Fort Spring Missionary Baptist Church</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Fort Spring Missionary Baptist Church was organized by Rev. L.L. McDaniel in 1948. Church services were held in the Union Hall until the Congregation could build a church. Land was given by I.E. Sowards. Timber was cut on the Ira Lewis farm to saw into lumber for the church. The church was dedicated in 1950. A small corner of the ground was given by Charles and Blanche Hanger in 1971.

          Throughout the years the church flooded several times and the church records were lost. At first the church had pretty hardwood floors but after some flooding the church floor was raised by several feet and a concrete floor poured. Two Sunday School rooms were built on to the church and a baptistery installed in 1980. Rest rooms were added later. A devastating flood came on November 4, 1985 and almost everything was destroyed inside the church building. With much dedication, prayer and hard work services were held again in the church in two weeks. A rededication service was held on July 27, 1986.

          On January 19 and 20, 1996 another devastating flood hit our area and the church was flooded worse this time. After much more prayer and hard work, services were held again in the original building on February 11, 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          On February 12, 1996, a special meeting was held and it was decided to build a new church building and began praying and searching for a new site. We were successful in buying the old Fort Spring School property at public auction on May 30, 1996. Because of the grace and guidance of our Lord, many people donated money, time and much hard work to successfully build the new church as we know it today. On Sunday, December 1, 1996, the dedication for the new church building was held.

          The old church building served as the youth center and because of the all knowing God that we have, we were able to keep the old building in condition enough to sell the building in 2009. The last service was held at the old building on May 10, 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the sale of the old church building, plans began for the building of the new youth center. With the completion of the youth center, in 2012 we were able to begin the Awana program for the youth. This program reaches many youth and leaders with the gospel of Christ.

          Even though the old building was full of memories and Christian bonds were strengthened there, we knew it was not the building but the people who make it a church family. Each year we have new memories and new blessings. God has continued to bless our church. We thank God for His infinite mercies and love.
