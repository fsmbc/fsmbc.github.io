        <h2>
          Salvation through Jesus Christ
        </h2>
        <p>
          This life is full of questions. Two of the most asked questions by any of us are:
        </p>
          <p class="text-center">
          <span class="bg-primary rounded px-1 text-white me-1">
            What is my purpose in life?</span>
          <br>and<br>
          <span class="bg-primary rounded px-1 text-white me-1">
            What will happen to me when I die?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
          The truth is
          <span class="fw-bold text-primary text-serif">
            you can't be ready to live until you are ready to die</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Word of God teaches us...
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
                  Romans 5:12, "...by one man [Adam] sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
                  Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            <code>
                  Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life though Jesus Christ our Lord."
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, to be ready to die means that you make sure you have eternal life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
                  Ephesians 2:8-9, "For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Just simply accept God's free gift of grace by praying to Him in faith, believing that Jesus is alive, confessing to Him that you have sinned, asking forgiveness and that you desire for Him to be your Savior.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
            Romans 10: 9-10 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now if you have prayed that prayer and meant it with your whole heart, you have eternal life and can truly begin to live.
          </p>

            <code>
            1 John 5:12 "He that hath the Son [Jesus] hath life..."
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please
