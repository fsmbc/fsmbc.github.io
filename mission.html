                Mission Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our mission at Fort Spring Missionary Baptist Church is to simply teach and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that the mission of the church is to produce other Christians
            </p>
            <p>
                We strive to plant  the seed of God's word and allow His Spirit to work in the hearts of those who hear
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that the future of God's earthly church relies heavily upon the development and nurturing of our young people
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that salvation is a free gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ
