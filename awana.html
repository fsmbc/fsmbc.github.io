                <h2>Awana</h2>
                <p>
                    Awana is a worldwide nonprofit ministry focused on providing Bible-based evangelism and discipleship solutions for ages 3 to 18. As the global leader in child and youth discipleship, Awana gives children the opportunity to know, love and serve Jesus, no matter their background. The acronym AWANA comes from the first letters of the phrase "Approved Workman Are Not Ashamed."

                <h3>Why Awana?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because Awana is fun!  It's what keeps kids coming back.  And while kids are having fun, they're learning and growing. So if you are looking for a program to change kids' lives, you've come to the right place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Awana club meetings are jam-packed with life changing experiences.  The meetings have leaders with a love for Jesus and a desire to help young people.  Club materials are filled with verses from the Bible and guidelines to help kids memorize and understand them.  Awana teaches kids that God is real, that He loves them and that He has expressed that love through Jesus Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Awana clubs exist to reach children and teens with the Gospel of Christ and to train them to serve Him in their everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our personal Awana goal is for children to grow physically, mentally, socially and spiritually because of participating in Awana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are different clubs for different age groups:

                <h3>What happens at an Awana meeting?</h3>
                <p>
                    An Awana meeting consists of 4 main parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Opening Ceremony - clubbers and leaders recite the pledges to the American and the Christian flag, the Bible and to the Awana flag and sing the Awana song.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bible Story/Study Time - a time consisting of an age-appropriate Bible message/lesson and songs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handbook Time - time devoted to Scripture memorization with as much one on one supervision as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Game Time - outdoor or indoor games designed to encourage friendly competition and good sportsmanship.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By making Awana fun and rewarding, children achieve and memorize scripture more easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, we will deviate from the schedule to accommodate special events such as the Awana Store.

                <h3>Theme Nights</h3>
                <p>
                    One Wednesday night each month we have a "Special Theme" where we dress according to the theme.  Birthdays for the present month are acknowledged.  Theme Nights are special times for our clubbers and are designed to encourage club attendance.

                <h3>Awards</h3>
                <p>
                    Each Awana clubber can earn "shares" or "play money" as reward for wearing their uniform, tennis shoes, club attendance, Sunday School and Church attendance, passing sections in their handbooks, bringing a friend, for positive actions, etc.  We strive to be consistent and fair when awarding shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Awana shares can then be used in our Awana store to purchase items on the designated Awana store nights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clubbers can also earn awards/badges for their uniforms/shirts as they finish sections of their handbooks.

                <h3>What is the Awana Store?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Awana Store is set up with items that kids love, ranging from small novelty items to gift cards to their favorite stores.  Clubbers can spend their shares whenever we have Store Night.  Donations that might encourage kids to learn are greatly appreciated.  See any Awana leader for suggested donations if you should want to donate items for this purpose.  The Awana Store will be open to the clubbers several times a year.
